hi! humans.
I am here.I like reading for three reasons.First of all,books introduce me to a new world,which is colourful and without time and space limit,Through reading,I can trace back.to ancient Egypt,the cradle of human civilization.It can bring myself to the United states,a glamorous land I have been longing to visit.Secondly,reading can better myself by showing me a new horizon.In the past years,most of my knowledge has been obtained from books.I have learned from many people by reading about their ideas on scithee,politics,life and society.Thirdly,reading bridge the gap between my dream and my goal.In ordcr to succeed in my career in the future,I must keep reading,thinking and practising.
Reading has become part of my life.Every day,I spend some time reading books,newspapcrs and magazines.At night,I can hardly go to steep without a novel in my hand.
